# customized-frameworks

This repository contains a versatile prompt template designed to help users generate frameworks for developing target skills in learners. The template can be easily used with Generative AI tools like ChatGPT to create customized and creative frameworks for any target skill and audience.

## Overview

The **Prompt Template** section provides the structure of the prompt, with placeholders for the specific goal, target skills, and requirements. The **Sample Prompt** section demonstrates an example of how to fill out the template. You can easily customize the template to suit your needs.

The purpose of this template is to generate 6 frameworks, with the first 3 being based on the goal(s) and requirement(s) provided, and the latter 3 being more creative adaptations. The output from the AI will help you create frameworks to guide learners in the development of the desired skills.

## Features

- Versatile prompt template: Easily adaptable to various target skills and audiences, allowing you to create customized frameworks for your specific needs.
- Supports a range of learning methods: The template is designed to accommodate different methods, including individual and collaborative processes, as well as on-the-spot analysis and deep reflection.
- Facilitates creative output: The template encourages Generative AI tools to provide both conventional and more creative customized frameworks, giving you a wide range of options to choose from.
- Easy integration with Generative AI tools: The template is designed to be easily used with popular AI tools, such as ChatGPT, streamlining the framework generation process.

## Prompt Template

```
Goal(s): 
I want to help [learners] develop [target skills] by [method(s)]. 

Requirement(s):
R1 [Use]. [description of requirement]
R2 [Use]. [description of requirement]
R3 [Design]. Multimodal

Based on my goal(s) and requirement(s), describe 3 customized frameworks for [target skills] for [learners].

Next, write 3 more creative customized frameworks.
```

## Sample Prompt (Ideation, College students)

```
Goal(s): 
I want to help learners develop the "ideation muscle" by practicing tools and techniques associated with ideation. 

Requirement(s):
R1 [Use].  For both individual and collaborative processes.
R2 [Use]. For on-the-spot analysis and deep reflection.
R3 [Design]. Multimodal

Based on my goal(s) and requirement(s), describe 3 customized frameworks for ideation for college students.

Next, write three more creative customized frameworks. 
```

## Sample Output (Ideation, College students)

Below are example frameworks generated using the sample prompt. These can serve as inspiration for your own customized frameworks.

### Framework 1: SCAMPER Technique

SCAMPER is an acronym for a series of ideation prompts that can be used individually or in a group setting. This technique encourages learners to think divergently and explore various possibilities by modifying existing ideas.

1. Substitute: Replace a component or feature with something else.
2. Combine: Merge two or more concepts or elements.
3. Adapt: Adjust an existing idea for a new purpose or context.
4. Modify: Change the size, shape, or other attributes of an idea.
5. Put to another use: Apply an existing concept in a new way.
6. Eliminate: Remove components or features to simplify an idea.
7. Reverse: Reverse the order or arrangement of components.

### Framework 2: Mind Mapping

Mind mapping is a visual technique that encourages learners to explore the connections between ideas and concepts. This framework can be done individually or collaboratively, using physical materials or digital tools.

1. Start with a central topic or question.
2. Branch out from the center with related subtopics.
3. Add keywords or images to represent ideas or concepts.
4. Use colors, symbols, and lines to show relationships between ideas.
5. Continue expanding branches with more subtopics or details.
6. Encourage participants to think creatively and explore new connections.

### Framework 3: Six Thinking Hats

This framework, developed by Edward de Bono, encourages learners to consider different perspectives and aspects of a problem or idea. It can be applied to both individual and group settings, promoting critical thinking and balanced decision-making.

1. White Hat: Focus on facts and information.
2. Red Hat: Express emotions and feelings.
3. Black Hat: Identify potential problems and risks.
4. Yellow Hat: Explore benefits and positive aspects.
5. Green Hat: Generate new ideas and possibilities.
6. Blue Hat: Manage the process, set objectives, and summarize conclusions.

### Framework 4: Random Stimuli

Random stimuli can help learners break away from traditional thinking patterns and generate new ideas by introducing unexpected elements.

1. Use random words, images, or objects as stimuli.
2. Encourage participants to create associations between the stimulus and the problem or topic.
3. Explore multiple associations and combinations.
4. Identify potential new ideas or solutions based on these associations.

### Framework 5: Rolestorming

Rolestorming is a variation of brainstorming that encourages participants to adopt different personas or roles to generate new ideas and perspectives.

1. Identify various roles relevant to the problem or topic.
2. Encourage participants to assume these roles during the ideation session.
3. Generate ideas from the perspective of the chosen roles.
4. Evaluate the ideas generated and discuss their relevance to the problem or topic.

### Framework 6: The Idea Box

The Idea Box is a creative problem-solving tool that encourages participants to deconstruct a problem or topic into various components and explore different combinations.

1. Identify the main components of the problem or topic.
2. vWrite each component on a separate piece of paper or index card.
3. Generate variations for each component.
3. Shuffle the cards and randomly draw one variation from each component.
4. Combine the variations to create a new solution or idea.
5. Discuss and evaluate the generated ideas.

## Usage

To use the prompt with Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, follow these steps:

1. Copy the entire **Prompt Template** section.
2. Replace the placeholders `[learners]`, `[target skills]`, and `[method(s)]` with your specific values.
3. Add your desired requirement(s) by replacing `[Use]` and `[description of requirement]` accordingly.
4. Paste the modified template into the input area of your Generative AI tool.
5. After receiving the output from the AI, you can review and adjust the generated frameworks as needed.
